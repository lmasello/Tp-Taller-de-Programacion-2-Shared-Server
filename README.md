# tp-taller-de-programacion-2-Shared-Server
Shared server repository for the semestral project of the subject 'Taller de ProgramaciÃ³n II'
of the University of Buenos Aires which consist of doing an application similar to Spotify.
This application is called 'music-io'.

## Heroku instance
https://music-io-shared-server.herokuapp.com/

## Run docker container
Note: Execute the following commands at the root of the project.
### Running the application
 - Run the docker image linked to a PostgreSQL database
```bash
docker-compose up
```
### Contribute to the seed file
If you want to add example data to the seed file (server/config/db/seed.sql), then you will have
to delete the container and the associated volume:
```bash
docker-compose rm -v postgres
```
And once then, run the container again:
```bash
docker-compose up
```
### What is the ip of the server?
```bash
docker inspect tptallerdeprogramacion2sharedserver_shared-server_1
```
And look for NetworkSettings->Networks->bridge->IPAddress

### Want to access the data base container?
- Get the available networks
```bash
docker network list
```
- Supose the network for docker compose is [network]
```bash
docker run -it --rm --network=[network] postgres bash
```

## Deploy to Heroku

 - Add the heroku remote

heroku git:remote -a music-io-shared-server
```
 - Deploy changes
```bash
git push heroku development:master
```

## Logger
In order to use logs during run time, we use the 'Winston' library
(https://github.com/winstonjs/winston).
Basically, you have to call `var logger = require('./config/logger/winston.js');` in your js file
and then call it in the following ways:
```
logger.error('Error message');
logger.warn('Warn message');
logger.info('Info message');
logger.debug('Debug message');
```
Note that the error and warn messages will be saved to the file 'logfile.log' whereas all kinds of
messages (error, warn, info and debug) will appear on the console.
